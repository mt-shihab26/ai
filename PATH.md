# Learning AI from scratch is a step-by-step process

## **1. Build Foundational Knowledge**

### Math (essential for understanding AI)

- **Linear Algebra** (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- **Calculus** (derivatives, gradients, partial derivatives)
- **Probability & Statistics** (Bayes' theorem, distributions, expectations)

Resources:

- Khan Academy (free)
- 3Blue1Brown's [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCs7Qoc_8tP7YJ2RJmI5C8e)

### Programming (Python is key)

- Learn Python basics: data types, control flow, functions, OOP
- Practice problem solving (e.g., with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/))

Resources:

- Python Crash Course (book)
- freeCodeCamp’s [Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)

## **2. Learn Core AI/ML Concepts**

### Topics:

- **Machine Learning types**: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
- **Key algorithms**: Linear regression, Decision Trees, K-Means, SVM, Neural Networks
- **Model evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC

Courses:

- Andrew Ng’s ML course on Coursera (highly recommended)
- Google’s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

---

## **3. Hands-On with ML Libraries**

Learn tools like:

- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML models
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning

Projects to try:

- Predict house prices (linear regression)
- Spam email detector (classification)
- Customer segmentation (clustering)

---

## **4. Dive into Deep Learning**

Learn how neural networks work:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — for image data
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** — for sequence/time-series data
- **Transformers** — modern NLP foundation (like ChatGPT)

Courses:

- Deep Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng, Coursera)
- fast.ai’s [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

---

## **5. Specialize in an Area**

Choose based on your interest:

- **Computer Vision** (object detection, facial recognition)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (chatbots, sentiment analysis)
- **Reinforcement Learning** (robotics, game AI)
- **AI Ethics & Safety** (interpretability, fairness, bias)

---

## **6. Build Real-World Projects & Portfolio**

Ideas:

- Image classifier
- Chatbot using transformers
- Stock price predictor
- AI-powered game bot

Use GitHub to showcase your code. Write blogs or document your learning on platforms like Medium or GitHub Pages.

## **7. Stay Current & Engage with the Community**

- Read papers on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/)
- Follow top AI conferences: NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ACL
- Join AI communities (Reddit, Discord, Twitter/X, Kaggle)

---

## Optional Tools & Platforms

- **Kaggle** (for datasets and competitions)
- **Colab** or **Jupyter Notebooks** (for easy experimentation)
- **Hugging Face** (for NLP models)
- **Weights & Biases / MLflow** (for experiment tracking)
